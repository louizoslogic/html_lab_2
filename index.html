            <h6>Dec 30th 2020</h6>

            <p>
                On Todays of episode of THE SAUCE! We made some veggie broth dudes and dudettes. We did it by collecting a heck ton of scaps I had laying around my place, and boiling em up in some water.

                Once I decided to let them thaw overnight but you don't need to do it that way. Then I just put my scraps into a big pot of water along with some salt and fresh thyme. measure out your scraps by cups, and put twice as much water in your pot. 
                
                From there I put it to boil, and brought down the heat to simmer for two hours once the bubbles started rumbling. 

                I bottled them in a mason jar and should have frozen a few because I made some much that I couldn't finish it all.
